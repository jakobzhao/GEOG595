## [Practical Exercise 4: Creating geo-narratives with Mapbox storytelling library](pe.md)

In this practical exercise, you are expected to make a web based interactive storymap with a storytelling library from Mapbox. Geo-Narrative is an evolving concept in modern cartography and geovisualization, and has been frequently used by Geographers, GIScientists, and Data Journalists. It aims to use differenet geovisual approaches to narrate/represent a geographic phenomenon often in the form of web based interactive maps. From a practical perspective, an attractive and precise geo-narrative should use multiple media instead of only drawing maps. For example, pictures, videos, scripts, audio, and so on can also support the development of a geo-narrative. In recent years, with the convegence of geospatial, information and mobile techiniques, a geo-narrative are integrated with virtual reality, augumented reality, also supported by real-time geospatial data feeds.
