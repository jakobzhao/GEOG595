## [Practical Exercise 5: Place context analysis using Natural Language Processing](pe.md)

In this practical exercise, you are expected to use Natural Language Processing to explore a book author's sense of place about Seattle. Natural Language Processing (NLP), as a typical machine learning algorithm, aims to inteprete the context of a large text corpora with the support from insteading of a human being. Obviously, NLP can learn a large amount of text with ease, and can summarize its major context using multiple functions and analyses. Sense of place indicates an individual's perception, emotion,  or altitude towards a place. If an individual has recorded one's sense of place, it is possible to interprete the author's sense of place to process the record using NLP. Below, we will explore Gary L. Atkins's sense of place about Seattle. To do so, we will mainly use NLP to process his book entitled *Gay Seattle*. Specificially, we plan to explore multiple perspectives of Gary's sense of place. For example, we would like to get a general picture about his impression of Seaettle using word cloud, and then plot the spatial dimension of Gary's perception of `Seattle`, and then try to visualize Gary's sense of palce using network analysis. Let us get started!
