## Notes:

1. Technics
2. lifeworld (lebenswelt)
3. Sense of Place vs. Scales of Space
4. Yifu Tuan (1976) vs. Torsten Hagerstand (1978)
5. Alexander von Humboldt vs. Wihelm von Humboldt
6. Humanistic Geography
7. Multistability
8. Ihde has, from a phenomenological perspective, characterized this mediating role of artifacts in terms of what he calls technological intentionality (Ihde 1990, 141). By this he means that technologies – like consciousness for Husserl – have a certain directionality, an inclination or trajectory that shapes the ways in which they are used.
9. The essence of technology: revealing (pp. 12) vs. enframing.
10. Standing-reserve (Bestand, pp17, pp19)
